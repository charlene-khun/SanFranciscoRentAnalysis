# San Francisco Rent Analysis
This project is for my CS133 Introduction to Data Visualization class. The code performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Project Members: Charlene Khun, Helena Thiessen, Benny Chen, and Rongjie Mai

How to Run the Code
1. Install the necessary Libraries: Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, re, folium, geopy, scikit-learn, and scipy. 
You can install them using pip: pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib re folium geopy scikit-learn scipy OR !pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib folium geopy scikit-learn scipy (when using Jupyter Notebooks on Google Colab).

Below, are some main imports that we used in the project.
![CS133Imports1](CS133README_images/CS133Imports1.jpg)
![CS133Imports2](CS133README_images/CS133Imports2.jpg)

Please be sure to check for any additional imports in the Google Colab file.

2. Access the Dataset: Obtain the Rent Board Housing Inventory dataset from the provided URL from the “References” page on page 16 of the report. 
3. Execute the Code: Run the Python code blocks in a Jupyter Notebook (from Google Colab) or a similar environment. The code performs data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation.
4. Interpret Results: Analyze the generated visualizations, model performance metrics, and feature importances to gain insights into San Francisco's rental market trends.
